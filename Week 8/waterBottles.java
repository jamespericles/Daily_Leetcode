 * Given numBottles full water bottles, you can exchange numExchange empty water bottles for one full water bottle.
 *
 * The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.
 *
 * Example:
 *      Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
 *      Output: 13
